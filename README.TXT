This is a simplified MIPS Pipeline processor implemented in VHDL. I took a test implementation that was provided by
Eduardo Todt (http://www.inf.ufpr.br/todt/) and modified it.

In prog.txt are the intructions executed by the processor. You can change it if you want.

Just run make. Remember that you need to have ghdl and gtkwave installed on your system.
